# cozy job tracker 🌱

calm tracking for a noisy job search.

paste a job url, cozyjobtracker parses it, and keep everything organized in one cozy spot.

## what it does

- **auto parsing** — drop in a job url and watch it extract title, company, location, salary, and more
- **stress-free tracking** — move jobs through your pipeline: saved → applied → interview → offer
- **custom columns** — add whatever fields make sense for your search (referral? vibe check? notes to self?)
- **share with friends** — send your board to a friend who's also in the thick of it
